## Homework1
  ### Design an ER Diagram using following information
  1. Employees would mandatorily need to sign up via a registration system where they need to provide their employee ID, a smartphone number and optionally an email address. They will then be required to install an app that would let them get alerts and do reporting of their health.
2. The company would randomly scan employees as they enter the facility or when they exit, taking their temperature. Any employee that has a fever, would be immediately tested onsite for COVID-19; at random, employees will also be singled out for testing even if they don't display a high temperature (this is to catch presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases).
3. Employees can also self-report (using their app), if they develop COVID-19 symptoms (any of five symptoms that the company would like them to report). Such employees will be required to undergo a test, and report the result (positive or negative) to the company (again, via their app); they can get tested at a location of their choice, or choose to be tested onsite at their company.
4. Employees who test positive would be triggers for initiating contact tracing.
5. Close contact between employees that happens during meetings, is always recorded, via the employees' apps - the location (meeting room number and floor), and the meeting start time.
6 As soon as an employee tests positive, the contact tracing system kicks in - others who were in close proximity (ie in a meeting) with this employee, will be notified via their phone (in the form of a live call from HR), and additionally, if they provided an email address, via email.
7. The notified employees are expected to get tested as soon as they can, and report the result (again, they can get tested at a location they choose, or onsite at their company) - if any of them tests positive, the contact tracing procedure is repeated for others who were in proximity, until all affected employees have been notified and tested. Sick employees (who tested positive) are expected to self-quarantine for two weeks (unless they end up going to a hospital to get admitted), and during that time, report their status to the company daily - the status would be 'sick', 'hospitalized' or 'well'. An employee who feels well after two weeks is allowed to return to work, and the hospitalized ones come back to work upon recovery (after reporting a 'well' status); there is a chance that a hospitalized employee could become deceased :(
8. Also, employees on the same floor as the sick employee are notified as well, but this time, with a message of concern, suggesting that they consider getting tested (not mandatory) - because such employees might have gotten sick, on account of virus transmission via door handles, restrooms or break rooms/kitchens.
