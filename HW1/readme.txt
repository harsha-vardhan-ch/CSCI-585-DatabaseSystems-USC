HW1 DB of Harsha Vardhan Charagondla ( 1444793835 )-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------App has following Features=> Symptom Assessment=> Covid Results=> Upload Result=> Location Data=> Health Status=> Initiate TracingThe app can have above features which cannot be displayed in the ER diagram.Location data of all employees, initiate Tracing features will be accessed by HR Department only.____________________________________________________________________________Each employee can register only for once using the unique emp id given to them by company. A backend registration id is generated which is also unique and is not visible to users. The app link is available only when details provided are valid and registration is successful=> The relation between employee and register entities are ONE AND ONLY ONE as each employee can register using 1 emp id and each register id is unique to emp id.=> The relation between register and app entities are ONE OR MANY as the employee can download the app and multiple times in many devices using same employee credentials.____________________________________________________________________________=> The relation between company and employees is ONE OR MANY as the company will contain a minimum of 1 employee and at most n no. of employees.Employee would be scanned randomly at the scanning site of the company, where they would note the emp id, temperature, date, and time of scanning. => The relation between employee and scanning entities are ZERO or ONE as the employees are choose randomly for scanning and not every employee is chosen for scanning. It is optional since all employees are not chosen.=> The relation between scan and Testing entities are ONE AND ONLY ONE (Imagining there will be only 1 scanning and 1 onsite testing center.) Consider 2 cases of testingPriority testing Ð It is done for employees whose temperature is high.Random Testing Ð It is done for randomly selected employees to identify asymptomatic case or presymptomatic case.

____________________________________________________________________________Through the app, employees can verify themselves of covid symptoms.If employee has any one of the 5 symptoms mentioned in the symptom assessment of the app, he/she needs to undergo onsite/offsite covid testing immediately.The onsite covid results are automatically updated to the app, whereas offsite results are to be uploaded to app by employee

There is no relation between employee and onsite testing entity as temperature scan is mandatory before onsite testingThe relation between employee and offsite testing center is of 2 types.=> In the first type employee has many testing options, and he may give his sample in any one of the locations. So, this is a ONE OR MANY relation.=> In the second type the result is unique to him, so it is a ONE AND ONE relation.

=> Both the relations are optional since it is up to employee choice to go to company testing site or other testing site of his choice.=> Many results are uploaded to single app, so the relation between on site and app is ONE OR MANY.____________________________________________________________________________If any of the employee reports are positive, contact tracing is initiated and HR department notifies the close proximity employees and same floor employees by analyzing the records of meetings available in the app. The relation between app and HR department is ZERO OR MANY as there may be zero or many positive cases of positive cases that needs to be taken care by HR department.The above relation is optional since there may or may not be positive covid cases.
Employees need to report their status (well, sick, hospitalized) in the app.
Company monitors the employee health status of each employee which is available in the app that must be self-reported by employee.
